                        Jaime, a web developer, is disillusioned by our immersion in the digital world and his own 
                        hand in its creation. When a colleague returns from a survival school hidden in the Catskill 
                        Mountains, Jaime decides, what the hell, why not?
                        <br><br>
                        Making fire with sticks, butchering animals, crafting a bow—these are a few things Jaime 
                        will come to learn. All the while, the school’s enigmatic founder, A, whispers of Day Zero,
                         her prophecy that the world will end and be born anew. “I’ll not bullshit you,” Jaime says,
                          “This story is about her.”
                        <br><br>
                        As A’s congregation becomes more fervent, the day arrives and civilization outside of the school
                         collapses, just as she had foreseen. In the aftermath, A’s grip tightens as she forces her
                          followers into obedience. Jaime begins to understand that she will do anything to sculpt
                           her vision into a reality, even as blood begins to spill.
